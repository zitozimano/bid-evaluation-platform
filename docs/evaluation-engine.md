# Evaluation Engine

The evaluation engine is composed of five subsystems:

1. Scoring Engine
2. Evidence Completeness Engine
3. Compliance Gating Engine
4. Risk Adjustment Engine
5. Consolidation Engine

## Scoring Engine
- Applies weights to raw scores.
- Produces a weighted total.

## Evidence Engine
- Ensures all required evidence is provided.

## Compliance Engine
- Ensures all required compliance items are satisfied.

## Risk Engine
- Applies a risk adjustment factor based on average risk score.

## Consolidation
- Final score = weighted total × risk adjustment.
